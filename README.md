# HACKATHON inFer GW4 network "Fertility: In Vitro, In Silico, In Clinico"

GOAL: Classify and visualize spermatozoonâ€™s flagella by creating a tool that will analyses the beat pattern data and characterizes flagella waveforms in bovine spermatozoa.


RESULT: The Sperm Beat Analysis Platform is launched here.

# Introduction: 

Despite the crucial role of sperm flagellar waveforms in cell motility, computer-aided sperm analysis systems have traditionally faced challenges in examining these complex patterns due to obstacles related to information extraction, manipulation, and processing. Recent advancements in imaging techniques and data processing have significantly enhanced waveform digitization methods. However, even when spermatozoa appear normal in microscopic observations, issues in the distal region, such as blebbing, may go unnoticed, making it challenging to determine amplitude, frequency, and distinguish between fresh and frozen sperm. To address these limitations, we have chosen to develop a machine learning model specifically designed to classify sperm beat patterns based on provided data. This model will not only discern abnormalities like blebbed sperm but will also evaluate its accuracy in distinguishing between fresh and frozen samples. Our platform integrates user-friendly features, enabling researchers to easily reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript. Additionally, the platform operates in real-time, facilitating immediate analysis and interpretation of results. 
This approach facilitates exploration and understanding of the research findings. Moreover, the platform's capability to identify anomalous beat patterns within the dataset adds a valuable layer of insight to sperm analysis.
The project meets the requirements of the hackathon in the following ways:
Specific: We created a Platform to classify sperm beat pattern classification, identify anomalous beat patterns in the dataset and user-friendly that allows researchers to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.
Measurable: Our digital solution aims to deliver measurable outcomes in the realm of sperm analysis. The machine learning model, designed to classify sperm beat patterns, not only identifies abnormalities like blebbing but also rigorously evaluates its accuracy in distinguishing between fresh and frozen sperm samples. 
Achievable: our digital solution is both sensible and practical, (but mostly practical), successfully implemented within the allocated time frame and utilizing available resources. It stands as an efficient and comprehensive tool for sperm pattern classification and anomaly detection, meeting the needs and expectations of researchers in the field.
